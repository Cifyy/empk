# empk
A Python application made to fetch, process, and deliver public transport data from MPK Krak√≥w. Featuring a RESTful API, it enables users to access up-to-date departure schedules for individual stops and to identify the closest stops based on location.

## Overwiew 
The project's purpose is to aggregate public transportation data in a structured and accessible manner. Its core objective is to transform raw transit data into actionable, easily accessible information through an API.

#### Project features two executable files:
- Updater, runs daily at night, checking if newer public data is avaliable, based on version saved in versions.txt file. If an update exists it reinitializes the database with the latest data.
- Api, hosts a FatAPI process on port 8000.
